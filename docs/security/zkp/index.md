# Zero-Knowledge Proof

Zero-knowledge proofs are a cryptographic concept and a set of protocols that allow one party, called the prover, to
demonstrate to another party, called the verifier, that they possess certain knowledge or information without revealing
what that knowledge or information is. In other words, zero-knowledge proofs enable a party to prove that they know a
secret or have access to specific data without disclosing the actual content of that secret.

The primary goals of zero-knowledge proofs are privacy, security, and trust. They are particularly valuable in
situations where one party needs to authenticate themselves or prove their knowledge of something to another party
without revealing any sensitive details. Zero-knowledge proofs are used in various applications, including cryptography,
cyber-security, and privacy-preserving technologies.
